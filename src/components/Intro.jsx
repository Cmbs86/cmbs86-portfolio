          Hey, I'm Carlos Sousa, a 37-year-old DCI student diving headfirst into
          the world of web development.

          I may not have all the answers, but I've got determination and a knack
          for finding bugs (the digital kind, not the creepy-crawly ones). Join
          me on this web development journey, where we embrace the quirks,
          celebrate the small wins, and have a good laugh at the occasional
          digital mishap. "Let's make the web a bit more interesting, one line
          of code at a time."
